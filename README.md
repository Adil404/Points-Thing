## To set up:

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to your ServiceNow instance
3. Go to `System Applications` => `Studio`
4. Once Studio loads, select `Import From Source Control`
5. Use your forked repo to [Import your application](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/quebec/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_devenvironment_quebec_importing_an_application_from_source_control)
6. See below on how to get this bot working on your own slack server
7. Make updates to the application (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details)
8. In Studio, commit your changes to source control
9. Submit a pull request to the ServiceNowDevProgram/Points-Thing `main` branch

An accepted Pull Request and merge does not necessarily mean the functionality will go live immediately, as an admin for the host instance will need to pull the application into ServiceNow.
