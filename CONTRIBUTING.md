## General requirements

- Pull request descriptions must be explicit and descriptive to what is being changed.
  - Changes that are not within the scope of the description will result in the entire PR being rejected
- No updates should be made directly to the automatically generated ServiceNow folders. Updates to these files should be done via the [Regular method](README.md#manually) described on the readme.
- Low effort/spam Pull Requests will be marked as spam accordingly.
- Filenames should not have special characters that are not allowed on normal file systems (eg. do not put ! in the file name).
